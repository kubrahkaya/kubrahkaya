<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kübra 👋</h1>

🚀 Senior Android Engineer | Community Leader

I have 10+ years of professional experience building high-quality, scalable Android apps. I’m a Kotlin lover and an AI enthusiast, especially interested in how AI can enhance mobile experiences.

I work as a contractor, which has given me the opportunity to collaborate with many talented Android developers across London while contributing to large-scale consumer Android apps in the automotive & mobility space. Alongside my industry work, I actively support the Android ecosystem through speaking, mentoring, and open-source contributions. 

I’ve been a proud GDG Organizer and community member since 2014.
